# GitHub Pages Starter

This is a simple, mobile-friendly starter for a static website you can host on GitHub Pages.

## How to use

1. Create a new **public** repository on GitHub (e.g., `my-site`).
2. Upload all files from this folder to your repository root (keep the same structure).
3. Go to **Settings â†’ Pages**:
   - Source: **Deploy from a branch**
   - Branch: **main** (or `master`) and folder: **/ (root)**
   - Save.
4. Wait ~1 minute. Your site will be live at:
   - `https://USERNAME.github.io/REPO-NAME/`
5. Edit `index.html`, `styles.css` and `assets/logo.svg` to customize.

### Tips
- Replace `you@example.com` in `index.html` with your email.
- Put your images in the `assets/` folder and reference them like `assets/photo.jpg`.
- If you see a 404, make sure `index.html` is at the repository root, not inside a subfolder.
- If using filenames or folders starting with `_` (underscores), add a file named `.nojekyll` to the root.
